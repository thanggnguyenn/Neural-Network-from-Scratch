# Neural-Network-from-Scratch

This is a remake version of this repository: [Neural Network from Scratch](https://github.com/Sentdex/nnfs_book/tree/main) and [Neural Network from Scratch in Different Programming Languages](https://github.com/sentdex/nnfsix).

In this repository, I chose two programming languages: Python and Julia as I like these two!

## **Python**

`forward_propagation.py`

In this file, I used a simple spiral dataset:

Then I used a simple network to learn from the data. This network has the following properties:

After training done, I copied down the weights and biases from the model and used it for my network built from Numpy. I found the results of these two networks are the same when making predictions with the 2 test examples.
